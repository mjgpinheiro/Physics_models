        "The provided code is designed to implement the Magic Formula investment strategy by automating the process of selecting stocks. It uses Python with libraries like yfinance for fetching financial data (P/E ratios and ROA) and pandas for data manipulation. The steps include setting up an IDE, retrieving stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance, organizing this data into a DataFrame with pandas, and then ranking the stocks based on the Magic Formula criteria. This ranking is achieved by creating a composite 'Magic Rank' from P/E and ROA rankings. The script concludes by filtering and sorting the stocks to identify the top choices according to their 'Magic Rank', making it easier to select the best five to seven stocks for investment purposes.\n",
