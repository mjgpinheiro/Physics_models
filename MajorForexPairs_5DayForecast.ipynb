        "Library Imports and Setup:\n",

        "\n",
        "For each forex pair, a linear regression model is trained on the last 30 days of closing prices.\n",
        "The model then predicts the closing prices for the next 5 days.\n",
        "Growth Rate Calculations:\n",
        "\n",
        "The potential growth rate for each pair over the next 5 days is computed.\n",
        "Additionally, the daily growth rates are computed.\n",
        "Color-Coded Display:\n",
        "\n",
        "A custom function colorize_text is used to colorize growth rates based on their sign.\n",
        "Positive growth rates are rendered in green, while negative ones are in red.\n",
        "The final predictions are displayed using HTML rendering to apply the color-coding.\n",
        "By running the code, a user can quickly ascertain the predicted growth trends of major forex pairs over the upcoming 5 days, with color-coding providing an intuitive visualization of the predictions' bullish or bearish nature."
